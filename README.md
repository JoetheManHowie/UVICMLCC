# Competitions

This is the code for all competitions. Each competitions is stored in it's each folder.

## Data

Folder where all data is stored. Each person will need to download data seperately and store in this folder. The group will decide on a proper naming convention for the data so that all code uses the same file names. Data will not be included in repository; it will be added to the .gitignore.

## Development Branches

This is where the magic happens. All your coding/testing/training/*rough work* should be done here. Each person in the group will make their own development folder. Since my last name is Polson I will create a folder here called *Polson*.

## Models

Any models you are satisfied with for the data set should be stored here. Naming conventions will be decided later.

## Notebooks

This folder is exclusively for notebooks exploring the data set. These notebooks should be properly formatted and designed in a way such that other members of the team can learn about the data set.

# Misc

For anything that does not have to do with competitions.
